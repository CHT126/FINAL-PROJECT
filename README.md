For our final project, we are determing the best neighborhood based on safety and cleanliness 

# Charles Tran
First, Charles Tran will be determining which neighborhoods have a high ratio of people completely vaxed, booster and all. When talking about cleanliness, we have to make sure everybody is healthy and vaccinated for any sickness to come 

The main data set I used was vaccination in neighborhoods set. This told me how many people were vaccinated andhow many doeses they received.

Next, I will analyze the neighborhood police incidents dataset to see which neighborhood has the least occurence of police arrests. The dataset records the total number The neighborhoods with the least number of police arrests will be nominated as the safest neighborhoods.
